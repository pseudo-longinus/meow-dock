**A tool for 99% of personal end-devices, providing stable, low-latency, high-reliability operations without requiring a GPU or extra API compute purchases.**

## Problem Solved

Our goal is to encapsulate common operations on personal end-devices (e.g., searching the web and then asking an AI) into stable, low-latency, GPU-free modular components (MCPs or functions), bridging the last mile between AI and device operations.

## Target Users

This project mainly serves **individual developers and enterprises working on Agents, workflow automation, and other end-devices operation scenarios**.

## Features ✨

*   **Functions:** Operate websites/software with a single Python command. Currently supports: Baidu Search and Yuanbao Q&A
*   **Characteristics:**
*    (1). All supported website/software operations are performed on CPU, with no need for GPU or third-party LLM APIs, resulting in faster response times
*    (2). No need for users to purchase extra API compute resources, making it cost-effective
*    (3). Compared with pure cloud solutions, local operation offers better privacy


## Installation 🛠️

**Install from Source**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pseudo-longinus/meow-dock.git     # Open a command line (Windows cmd or PowerShell) and use the command to clone the code
    cd meow-dock  # Enter the folder
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment, and require Python>=3.12:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv        # Create a virtual environment
    .venv\Scripts\activate      # If you're on Windows, use this command to activate
    #source .venv/bin/activate  # If you're on Linux/macOS, use this command to activate
    ```

3.  **Install the project and its dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -e . -i https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/ --trusted-host mirrors.aliyun.com
    ```


## Example 1: Ask Yuanbao for a Corny Joke and Get the Result 🚀

```python
from meowdock.docking.docking_factory import DockingFactory
from meowdock.cmd.login.main import login
import sys


def main():
    # If this is your first time, you need to log in to Tencent Yuanbao
    login(urls=["https://yuanbao.tencent.com/chat/"])

    prompt = "Tell me a corny joke"
    print(f"Executing with Yuanbao using prompt: '{prompt}'...")
    # Use DockingFactory to get the yuanbao docking instance
    factory = DockingFactory()
    yuanbao_docking = factory.get_docking("yuanbao")
    # Use the docking's run method to execute the prompt
    result = yuanbao_docking.run(prompt)
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

# Example 2: Search and Summarize
```python
from meowdock.docking.docking_factory import DockingFactory
from meowdock.cmd.login.main import login


def main():
    # When login is invalid, you need to use login.py to log in.
    # login(urls=["https://yuanbao.tencent.com/chat/"])
    # Define parameters
    search_query = "Why is the price of gold rising?"
    search_engine = "baidu"

    try:
        # Initialize factory and get docking instances
        factory = DockingFactory()
        # Get search docking instance
        search_docking = factory.get_docking(search_engine)
        print(f"Searching for '{search_query}' using {search_engine}...")
        search_results = search_docking.run(search_query)
        if not search_results:
            print("No search results found.")
            return
        print("search_results:", search_results)
        yuanbao_docking = factory.get_docking("yuanbao")
        # Process search results with Yuanbao
        print("Processing search results with AI...")
        combined_prompt = f"Please summarize the key points about {search_query} based on these search results:\n\n{search_results}"
        analysis_result = yuanbao_docking.run(combined_prompt)

        # Display the analysis
        print("\nAnalysis result:")
        print("-" * 40)
        print(analysis_result)
        print("-" * 40)

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## FAQ 🗂️

1. Do I need to log in to the website?
Yes, you do. Because the program uses its own browser, you need to run login.py to log in instead of logging in directly from a common browser.  We will develop a more user-friendly login management module in the near future.

2. What websites are currently supported?
Currently, Yuanbao and Baidu Search are supported, and more will be added. You can submit the websites you want to be supported here:
https://docs.qq.com/form/page/DSkx1cmZCSnh3cFBR

3. Why might it not work?
It may be because the target website/software interface or version has changed. You can try pulling the latest updates and try again:
```bash
git pull origin main
```

If the issue persists, please don't hesitate to contact us. Feel free to submit the log file log\executor\xxx.zip to the issue tracker or email it to guanzhao3000@gmail.com. we will analyze the issues and optimize our project accordingly.
